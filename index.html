	<h1>Why Dvorak?</h1>
	<h2>A statistical approach</h2>
	
	What makes the Dvorak keyboard layout better?
	
	<div id="fingerChart"></div>
	<div id="handChart"></div>
	<div id="distanceChart"></div>

	<h4>Same Finger Count</h4>
	<p>Same Finger Count indicates how many times the same finger was used consecutively.</p>
	<p>With QWERTY keyboard when typing the word "yumminess", you will have to use your right-index finger 4 times consecutively. We want this number to be low, as that means when one finger presses a key the other can get ready to press the next key.</p>

	<h4>Same Hand Count</h4>
	<p>Same Hand Count indicates how many times the same hand was used consecutively.</p>
	<p>With QWERTY keyboard to type the word "starwars" your right hand will sit idle while your left hand types the entire word.</p>

	<h4>Distance Travelled</h4>
	<p>Distance Travelled shows how far the fingers had to travel from their resting positions in the home row.</p>
	<p>For the QWERTY keyboard, the "F" key is considered to be at distance 0, because the left-index finger rests on it. "G" key is at distance 1 and "T" is at distance 2.</p>
